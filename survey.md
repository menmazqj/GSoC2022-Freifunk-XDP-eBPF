# statistics of wifi traffic

### for transmission rate control

- ACK (Acknowledgement)
  
  packet loss ratio   
  average transmission time
  
- SNR (Signal to Noise)

- BER (Bit Error Rate)

  average number of bit errors in each frame
  
  
### open source project about wifi analysis

- wifi_statistics (get rid of some features like BSSID, SSID)
